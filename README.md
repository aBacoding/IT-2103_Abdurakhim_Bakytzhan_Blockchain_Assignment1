Course: Blockchain Technologies Assignment: Implementing a Basic Blockchain with Merkle Tree

Objective: The objective of this programming assignment is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology and provide hands-on experience in implementing a basic blockchain system with the inclusion of a Merkle tree. This assignment does not require knowledge of dApps, Solidity, or smart contracts.

Instructions:
1. Investigate Blockchain Principles (5 points):
• Before starting the implementation, students should investigate blockchain
principles and working mechanisms by utilizing internet resources,
textbooks, or academic papers. Gain a solid understanding of how
blockchain technology functions.

2. Team Formation (Optional):

• Students have the option to form teams of up to 3 members for this
assignment.

3. Blockchain Implementation (Programming Task):
3.1 Define Blockchain Structure (10 points):
• Clear and complete definition of block structure.
3.2 Initialize Blockchain (10 points):
• Proper initialization of the blockchain with a genesis block.
3.3 Add Blocks (15 points):
• Successful implementation of block addition with proper linking.
3.4 Handle Transactions (15 points):
• Effective mechanism for transaction handling within blocks.
3.5 Merkle Tree Integration (15 points):
• Proper integration and utilization of a Merkle tree for transaction storage and
verification.
3.6 Block Validation (10 points):
• Robust block validation process ensuring block integrity.
3.7 Version Control (VCS) (10 points):
• Effective use of VCS, including regular commits by all team members.
3.8 Interface Integration (10 points):
• Integration of an interface enabling user interactions. Students have the
flexibility to create various types of interfaces, including web, API, GUI,
functional, or console interfaces.
3.9 Final Review (5 points):
• Comprehensive review of the blockchain implementation.

4. Demonstration and Q&A (Individual or Team Task) (15 points):
• Effective demonstration of blockchain functionality, including the Merkle
tree.
• Clear and confident responses to questions related to the program's
functionality and contributions to the VCS.
