Course: Blockchain Technologies Assignment: Implementing a Basic Blockchain with Merkle Tree

Objective: The objective of this programming assignment is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology and provide hands-on experience in implementing a basic blockchain system with the inclusion of a Merkle tree. This assignment does not require knowledge of dApps, Solidity, or smart contracts.

Instructions:

1. Investigate Blockchain Principles (5 points):

- Before starting the implementation, students should investigate blockchain
  principles and working mechanisms by utilizing internet resources,
  textbooks, or academic papers. Gain a solid understanding of how
  blockchain technology functions.

  **Answer:**

  **Decentralization:** Unlike traditional systems where control is exercised by a single entity, in a blockchain, control is distributed among many computers (called nodes). Each of them has equal rights and access to all data.

  **Immutability:** Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it stays there forever. It cannot be changed or deleted, which keeps it honest and secure.

  **Consensus Mechanisms:** There are methods to ensure that everyone agrees that transactions are valid. Common methods include Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.

  **Smart Contracts:** These are a kind of digital contracts that automatically perform certain actions when conditions are met, without needing an intermediary.

  **Cryptography:** Techniques to ensure the security of data and authenticity of transactions.

  **Tokenization:** Assets can be turned into digital tokens on the blockchain, making them easy to exchange and transfer to different owners.

  **Peer-to-Peer Network (P2P):** Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating the need for intermediaries, thus reducing costs and speeding up the process.

  **Verification:** The process of checking that transactions and data are real and follow the rules in a blockchain network. Transactions are checked by the nodes in the network for validity before being added to the block.

  **Distributed:** Data and decisions are distributed across many computers, not just one. Everyone in the network has a copy of the ledger, so everything's transparent for all to see. Each computer, called a node, keeps a copy of all transactions and has a say in their verification. In this way, no one person or organization has complete control, making everything fairer and more secure.

2. Team Formation (Optional):

- Students have the option to form teams of up to 3 members for this
  assignment.

  **Answer:** I decided to do this assignment alone. My name is Abdurakhim Bakytzhan from group IT-2103.

3. Blockchain Implementation (Programming Task):

   3.1 Define Blockchain Structure (10 points):

- Clear and complete definition of block structure.

  3.2 Initialize Blockchain (10 points):

* Proper initialization of the blockchain with a genesis block.

  3.3 Add Blocks (15 points):

* Successful implementation of block addition with proper linking.

  3.4 Handle Transactions (15 points):

- Effective mechanism for transaction handling within blocks.

  3.5 Merkle Tree Integration (15 points):

* Proper integration and utilization of a Merkle tree for transaction storage and
  verification.

  3.6 Block Validation (10 points):

- Robust block validation process ensuring block integrity.

  3.7 Version Control (VCS) (10 points):

* Effective use of VCS, including regular commits by all team members.

  3.8 Interface Integration (10 points):

- Integration of an interface enabling user interactions. Students have the
  flexibility to create various types of interfaces, including web, API, GUI,
  functional, or console interfaces.

  3.9 Final Review (5 points):

* Comprehensive review of the blockchain implementation.

4. Demonstration and Q&A (Individual or Team Task) (15 points):

- Effective demonstration of blockchain functionality, including the Merkle
  tree.

* Clear and confident responses to questions related to the program's
  functionality and contributions to the VCS.
